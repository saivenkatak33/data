## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes Nigerian agricultural exports data to uncover:
- Which products dominate export value and volume
- Who the leading export companies are
- The top importing countries
- Seasonal and yearly export trends

Dataset source: `nigeria_agricultural_exports-checkpoint.csv`  
Period covered: **2020 – 2023**  
Rows: **1,000** records

## **Dataset Columns**
- **Product Name** – Export commodity (e.g., Sesame, Cashew)
- **Company** – Exporting firm name
- **Export Country** – Destination
- **Date** – Shipment date
- **Units Sold** – Quantity
- **Unit Price** – NGN per unit
- **Profit per Unit**
- **Export Value** – Total revenue
- **Destination Port**
- **Transportation Mode** – Mostly "Sea"

## **Objectives**

1. Identify top export products by value and volume.
2. Find most profitable companies.
3. Map top export destinations.
4. Understand seasonal/yearly performance.

## **Conclusion**
Nigeria’s agricultural exports are dominated by a few key commodities and a small number of major exporters. Europe is the leading destination, with strong seasonal patterns. Sea freight from Lagos remains the primary trade route.

## **Next Steps**
- Extend analysis to trend forecasting.
- Track year-on-year growth per commodity.
